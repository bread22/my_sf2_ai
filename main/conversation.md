# PyTorch AI Plays Street Fighter
## User
Can you help me program an AI using pytorch on windows? I want the AI to play StreetFighterIISpecialChampionEdition-Genesis.  Please specify the version number of each library that
you are using.

Here are some requirement, 
1. I want to train the model with my GPU, RTX3080, 
2. please separate code to 3 modules, which are model.py, train.py, and play.py
3. I want to save progress during iterations, one model every 20 iterations/episodes
## ChatGPT
I can definitely help you get started with creating an AI to play Street Fighter II using PyTorch on Windows. First, let's set up your environment and make sure you have the required dependencies.

You will need to install the following libraries and their specific versions:

1. PyTorch - 1.10.0
2. torchvision - 0.11.1
3. gym - 0.19.0
4. gym-retro - 0.9.0

You can install them using pip:

```
pip install torch==1.10.0 torchvision==0.11.1 gym==0.19.0 gym-retro==0.9.0
```

Next, import the Street Fighter II ROM into the gym-retro library:

```
python -m retro.import /path/to/your/StreetFighterIISpecialChampionEdition-Genesis
```

Now, let's create the three Python files you requested: model.py, train.py, and play.py.

1. model.py: This file will contain the neural network architecture for your AI agent.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class StreetFighterAgent(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_shape, num_actions):
        super(StreetFighterAgent, self).__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(input_shape[0], 32, kernel_size=8, stride=4),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=4, stride=2),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(64, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=1),
            nn.ReLU()
        )

        conv_out_size = self._get_conv_out(input_shape)
        self.fc = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(conv_out_size, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(512, num_actions)
        )

    def _get_conv_out(self, shape):
        o = self.conv(torch.zeros(1, *shape))
        return int(np.prod(o.size()))

    def forward(self, x):
        conv_out = self.conv(x).view(x.size()[0], -1)
        return self.fc(conv_out)
```

2. train.py: This file will handle the training of your AI agent.

```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim
import gym
import gym_retro
import numpy as np
from model import StreetFighterAgent

# Set device
device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Create environment
env = gym.make('StreetFighterIISpecialChampionEdition-Genesis')
observation_shape = env.observation_space.shape
n_actions = env.action_space.n

# Initialize agent
agent = StreetFighterAgent(observation_shape, n_actions).to(device)
optimizer = optim.Adam(agent.parameters())

# Training parameters
num_episodes = 1000
max_timesteps = 10000
save_every = 20

for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    total_reward = 0

    for t in range(max_timesteps):
        action = agent.act(state)
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        total_reward += reward

        # Update agent
        agent.update(next_state, reward, done)

        state = next_state

        if done:
            break

    print(f"Episode: {episode}, Total Reward: {total_reward}")

    if episode % save_every == 0:
        torch.save(agent.state_dict(), f"model_{episode}.pth")
```

3. play.py: This file will enable your trained AI agent to

play the game.

```python
import torch
import gym
import gym_retro
import numpy as np
from model import StreetFighterAgent

def preprocess_state(state):
    # Implement any preprocessing required for the input state
    return state

# Set device
device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Create environment
env = gym.make('StreetFighterIISpecialChampionEdition-Genesis')
observation_shape = env.observation_space.shape
n_actions = env.action_space.n

# Initialize agent
agent = StreetFighterAgent(observation_shape, n_actions).to(device)

# Load trained model
model_path = "model.pth"  # Replace with the appropriate model filename
agent.load_state_dict(torch.load(model_path, map_location=device))
agent.eval()

state = env.reset()
done = False

while not done:
    env.render()

    state = preprocess_state(state)
    state = torch.tensor(state, dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0).to(device)
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        action = torch.argmax(agent(state)).item()
    
    next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
    state = next_state

env.close()
```

With these three files, you now have a basic structure for training and playing the game using your RTX 3080 GPU. Some parts of the code, such as the state preprocessing, might need to be adjusted based on the game environment. Additionally, the training code might require adjustments for your specific learning algorithm (e.g., DQN or PPO). The play.py file loads a saved model and lets the AI play the game with the learned policy.

## ChatGPT
Apologies for the confusion. It seems the input dimensions are not compatible with the first convolutional layer. The Street Fighter II environment has a screen resolution of 224x320 pixels, which should be the input dimensions. You may need to preprocess the input state by resizing and converting it to grayscale to reduce the dimensions.

Here's an updated version of the preprocessing function and agent initialization in train.py:

```python
import cv2

def preprocess_state(state):
    gray_state = cv2.cvtColor(state, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)
    resized_state = cv2.resize(gray_state, (84, 84))
    return resized_state

# Set device
device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Create environment
env = retro.make('StreetFighterIISpecialChampionEdition-Genesis')
state = env.reset()
preprocessed_state = preprocess_state(state)
observation_shape = (1, *preprocessed_state.shape)  # Add the channel dimension
n_actions = env.action_space.n

# Initialize agent
agent = StreetFighterAgent(observation_shape, n_actions).to(device)
```

Also, update the preprocess_state function in play.py:

```python
import cv2

def preprocess_state(state):
    gray_state = cv2.cvtColor(state, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)
    resized_state = cv2.resize(gray_state, (84, 84))
    return resized_state
```

And update the agent's input shape in model.py:

```python
class StreetFighterAgent(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_shape, num_actions):
        super(StreetFighterAgent, self).__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(input_shape[0], 32, kernel_size=8, stride=4),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=4, stride=2),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(64, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=1),
            nn.ReLU()
        )

        conv_out_size = self._get_conv_out(input_shape)
        self.fc = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(conv_out_size, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(512, num_actions)
        )
```

Now, the input state is preprocessed to a 84x84 grayscale image, which should work with the convolutional layers in the model. Please try running the code again with these changes.

## ChatGPT
Apologies for the oversight. It seems that I forgot to include the `act` method in the `StreetFighterAgent` class. Since the current implementation is minimal, I'll provide an epsilon-greedy action selection strategy for the `act` method. You can modify it later to fit your learning algorithm (e.g., DQN or PPO).

Please add the following method to the `StreetFighterAgent` class in `model.py`:

```python
import random

class StreetFighterAgent(nn.Module):
    # ...
    
    def act(self, state, epsilon=0.1):
        if random.random() < epsilon:
            return random.randrange(self.fc[-1].out_features)
        else:
            with torch.no_grad():
                state = torch.tensor(state, dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0).to(device)
                q_values = self.forward(state)
                return torch.argmax(q_values).item()
```

Now, the agent has an `act` method that takes the current state and an optional epsilon parameter (for exploration) and returns the selected action. This method uses an epsilon-greedy strategy: with a probability of epsilon, it selects a random action; otherwise, it selects the action with the highest Q-value as predicted by the model.

Make sure to import `random` at the top of `model.py`. Then, you should be able to run the `train.py` script without any issues.
## User
what is DQN and PPO? what is the difference? and which one I should use? Is any of them used in current code?
## ChatGPT
Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are two popular reinforcement learning algorithms with different approaches.

**DQN**:
DQN is a value-based method that combines Q-learning with deep neural networks. It learns an approximate action-value (Q-value) function, which represents the expected total reward when taking an action in a given state and following the optimal policy thereafter. The core idea is to use a neural network to predict Q-values for each action, and during training, the network is updated to minimize the difference between its predicted Q-values and the target Q-values (based on actual rewards and next states).

DQN introduces several improvements to stabilize and speed up learning, such as:
1. Experience Replay: DQN stores past experiences (state, action, reward, next state) in a replay buffer and samples mini-batches from this buffer for training, breaking the correlation between consecutive samples.
2. Target Network: DQN uses a separate target network to compute target Q-values, which is a copy of the main network that is updated less frequently. This reduces the risk of divergence due to oscillations in the Q-value estimates.

**PPO**:
PPO is a policy-based method that belongs to the family of policy gradient algorithms. It directly optimizes the policy that the agent follows by adjusting the parameters of a neural network representing the policy. The main idea behind PPO is to update the policy in a way that it doesn't deviate too much from the old policy, ensuring stable and efficient learning.

PPO introduces a trust region optimization approach by using a surrogate objective function that is clipped to prevent large policy updates, which might harm learning. This makes PPO more sample-efficient and stable compared to other policy gradient methods like TRPO (Trust Region Policy Optimization).

**Difference**:
The key difference between DQN and PPO is that DQN is a value-based method that estimates Q-values, while PPO is a policy-based method that directly optimizes the policy.

**Which one to use?**:
Both DQN and PPO have their own strengths and weaknesses. DQN generally works well in environments with discrete action spaces, while PPO is more flexible and can handle both discrete and continuous action spaces. PPO is often considered more sample-efficient and stable, making it a popular choice for many challenging tasks.

In your case, since Street Fighter II has a discrete action space, both DQN and PPO can be suitable choices. The current code provided is a minimal implementation and does not use any specific learning algorithm. You can modify it to incorporate either DQN or PPO based on your preference. If you're new to reinforcement learning, you might want to start with DQN, as it has a simpler implementation and can be easier to understand.

## ChatGPT
Apologies for the error. It looks like there is an issue with the input dimensions. The input state should have a single channel (grayscale) after preprocessing, but the error message suggests it has 200 channels.

This is likely due to the way the preprocessed state is being passed to the agent's `act` method in `train.py`. Since the preprocessed state is a 2D grayscale image, it needs to have an additional channel dimension before being passed to the agent. 

Please update the following lines in `train.py`:

```python
state = preprocess_state(state)
state = np.expand_dims(state, axis=0)  # Add channel dimension
action = agent.act(state)
```

Also, update the same lines in `play.py`:

```python
state = preprocess_state(state)
state = np.expand_dims(state, axis=0)  # Add channel dimension
action = torch.argmax(agent(state)).item()
```

This should resolve the error and allow you to run the code.

## ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. It seems the action returned by the `act` method is an integer, but the `env.step` function expects an array-like object representing the action. Since Street Fighter II uses a discrete action space, we need to convert the integer action into a one-hot encoded action vector.

Please add the following function to `train.py` to convert the integer action into a one-hot encoded action vector:

```python
def one_hot_encode_action(action, num_actions):
    encoded_action = np.zeros(num_actions)
    encoded_action[action] = 1
    return encoded_action
```

Then, update the following line in `train.py` to use the `one_hot_encode_action` function:

```python
next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(one_hot_encode_action(action, n_actions))
```

Also, update the same line in `play.py`:

```python

## ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the `update` method is missing in the `StreetFighterAgent` class. To provide you with a working example, I will give you a basic implementation using the DQN algorithm, as it is easier to implement and understand.

First, you need to implement a simple replay buffer in `train.py`:

```python
import collections

class ReplayBuffer:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.buffer = collections.deque(maxlen=capacity)

    def push(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        self.buffer.append((state, action, reward, next_state, done))

    def sample(self, batch_size):
        return random.sample(self.buffer, batch_size)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.buffer)
```

Then, add the following method to the `StreetFighterAgent` class in `model.py`:

```python
    def update(self, batch, optimizer, target_network, device, gamma=0.99):
        states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones = zip(*batch)

        states = torch.tensor(states, dtype=torch.float32).to(device)
        actions = torch.tensor(actions, dtype=torch.long).to(device).view(-1, 1)
        rewards = torch.tensor(rewards, dtype=torch.float32).to(device)
        next_states = torch.tensor(next_states, dtype=torch.float32).to(device)
        dones = torch.tensor(dones, dtype=torch.float32).to(device)

        current_q_values = self(states).gather(1, actions)
        next_q_values = target_network(next_states).max(1)[0].detach()
        target_q_values = rewards + gamma * next_q_values * (1 - dones)

        loss = F.smooth_l1_loss(current_q_values, target_q_values.unsqueeze(1))
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

This `update` method computes the loss using the DQN algorithm and updates the agent's parameters.

Now, modify the `train.py` script to use the replay buffer and train the agent using the DQN algorithm:

```python
batch_size = 64
replay_buffer = ReplayBuffer(10000)
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(agent.parameters(), lr=0.00025)
target_network = deepcopy(agent)

# ...

for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = preprocess_state(env.reset())
    state = np.expand_dims(state, axis=0)
    done = False

    while not done:
        action = agent.act(state)
        encoded_action = one_hot_encode_action(action, n_actions)
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(encoded_action)

        next_state = preprocess_state(next_state)
        next_state = np.expand_dims(next_state, axis=0)

        replay_buffer.push(state, action, reward, next_state, done)

        state = next_state

        if len(replay_buffer) > batch_size:
            batch = replay_buffer.sample(batch_size)
            agent.update(batch, optimizer, target_network, device)

    if episode % 20 == 0:
        torch.save(agent.state_dict(), f"saved_models/agent_{episode}.pt")
```

This code initializes the replay buffer, optimizer, and target network, and updates the agent's parameters using the DQN algorithm. It also saves the agent's model every 20 episodes.

Make sure to import `deepcopy` at the beginning of the `train.py` file:

```python
from copy import deepcopy
```

Now the code should work correctly and train the agent using the DQN algorithm. Note that this is a basic DQN implementation, and you might need to fine-tune the hyper
## User
what is the F in loss = F.smooth_l1_loss(current_q_values, target_q_values.unsqueeze(1)) ? it is not imported
## ChatGPT
I apologize for the oversight. The `F` stands for the `torch.nn.functional` module, which provides various functions for building neural networks. In this case, `F.smooth_l1_loss` computes the smooth L1 loss between the predicted and target Q-values. To fix the issue, simply import `torch.nn.functional` as `F` at the beginning of the `model.py` file:

```python
import torch.nn.functional as F
```

Now the code should work without any issues.
## User
how can I see the training process, I mean in action
## ChatGPT
To visualize the training process, you can render the environment while the agent is learning. To do this, you can add the following line in the training loop of the `train.py` script:

```python
env.render()
```

However, rendering the environment during training can slow down the training process. If you want to see the agent's progress without affecting the training speed, you can periodically save the model (as you are already doing every 20 episodes) and use the `play.py` script to test the agent's performance.

To see the agent in action using the saved models, update the `play.py` script as follows:

1. Load the saved model:

```python
model_path = "saved_models/agent_X.pt"  # Replace X with the episode number
agent.load_state_dict(torch.load(model_path))
```

2. Render the environment while playing the game:

```python
env.render()
```

Run the `play.py` script to see the agent's performance at various stages of the training process by changing the model file in the `model_path` variable. This way, you can observe the agent's improvement over time without slowing down the training.
## User
where do I put is render()? in for loop or in while loop?
## ChatGPT
You should put the `env.render()` inside the while loop in both `train.py` and `play.py`. This will allow you to see the agent's actions at each time step during both training and playing.

In `train.py`, place the `env.render()` right after the `next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(encoded_action)` line, like this:

```python
while not done:
    action = agent.act(state)
    encoded_action = one_hot_encode_action(action, n_actions)
    next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(encoded_action)
    env.render()  # Add this line
    # ...
```

In `play.py`, place the `env.render()` right after the `_, _, done, _ = env.step(one_hot_encode_action(action, n_actions))` line, like this:

```python
while not done:
    action = torch.argmax(agent(state)).item()
    _, _, done, _ = env.step(one_hot_encode_action(action, n_actions))
    env.render()  # Add this line
```

Adding `env.render()` in these locations will allow you to see the agent's actions in the environment at each time step. However, keep in mind that rendering the environment during training will slow down the training process. You can comment out the `env.render()` line in `train.py` if you only want to observe the agent's performance periodically using the `play.py` script.

how can I speed up? it is very slow like slow motion
## ChatGPT
The training process can be slow, especially when rendering the environment at each step. The rendering process takes additional time and resources, so it's best not to render the environment during training. If you want to observe the agent's performance, use the `play.py` script with the saved models.

To speed up training, follow these steps:

1. Remove or comment out the `env.render()` line in `train.py`. This will disable rendering during training and speed up the process:

```python
# env.render()  # Comment out or remove this line
```

2. Make sure you're using the GPU for training. The script should already be set up to use your GPU, but you can double-check by verifying that the `device` variable is set to "cuda" when a GPU is available:

```python
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
```

3. You can also try adjusting the training parameters to make training more efficient. For example, you can increase the batch size, learning rate, or replay buffer size. However, changing these parameters may also affect the quality of the trained model, so it may require experimentation to find the best configuration.

Finally, remember that training a reinforcement learning agent, especially on complex environments like video games, can take a significant amount of time. The training process may still take hours or even days, depending on the complexity of the game and the desired level of performance. Patience and experimentation are crucial in finding the right balance between training speed and performance.
## User
I just want to speed up the frames, still want to see the process in action, can I do that?
## ChatGPT
Yes, you can speed up the frames while still visualizing the training process. One way to achieve this is by using the `sleep()` function from the `time` module to control the time between frames. By decreasing the sleep time, you can increase the frame rate.

Here's an example of how you can modify the `train.py` and `play.py` files to control the frame rate:

1. Import the `time` module at the beginning of both `train.py` and `play.py`:

```python
import time
```

2. Add the `time.sleep(sleep_time)` line right after the `env.render()` line in both files. You can adjust the `sleep_time` variable to control the frame rate (smaller values will result in faster frame rates):

```python
sleep_time = 0.01  # Adjust this value as needed

# In train.py, inside the while loop:
env.render()
time.sleep(sleep_time)

# In play.py, inside the while loop:
env.render()
time.sleep(sleep_time)
```

Decreasing the `sleep_time` value will result in faster frame rates while still allowing you to see the training process in action. However, keep in mind that rendering the environment during training will still slow down the overall training process compared to not rendering at all.
## User
I don't have any sleep in my code, anyway I can get more frames per second?
## ChatGPT
Apologies for the confusion. I misunderstood your question earlier. If you want to increase the frames per second (FPS) during the training process without introducing `time.sleep()`, you can try adjusting the `retro` environment's settings.

To do this, you can modify the `train.py` file and set the `frameskip` option when creating the environment. The `frameskip` option determines how many frames the environment should skip before applying the agent's action. By default, the `frameskip` is set to 4, which means the agent's action is applied every 4 frames. Reducing the `frameskip` value should result in more frames per second.

Update the `retro.make()` line in `train.py`:

```python
env = retro.make(game='StreetFighterIISpecialChampionEdition-Genesis', state='Champion.Level1.RyuVsGuile', scenario='scenario', record=False, players=1, inttype=retro.data.Integrations.STABLE, obs_type=retro.Observations.IMAGE, frameskip=2)  # Change frameskip value
```

In this example, I set `frameskip=2`, which means the agent's action will be applied every 2 frames instead of 4. This should result in a higher FPS. Note that setting a lower `frameskip` value may increase the training time, as the agent will need to process more frames.

However, if you are experiencing slow rendering of the game screen, it may be limited by the rendering capabilities of the emulator itself. In that case, increasing the FPS might not be possible without changing the underlying emulator settings or using a different emulator.

I have this warning
D:\bread22\git-repos\my_sf2_ai\main\model.py:51: UserWarning: Creating a tensor from a list of numpy.ndarrays is extremely slow. Please consider converting the list to a single numpy.ndarray with numpy.array() before converting to a tensor. (Triggered internally at  ..\torch\csrc\utils\tensor_new.cpp:201.)
  states = torch.tensor(states, dtype=torch.float32).to(device)
## ChatGPT
This warning is triggered when you're creating a PyTorch tensor from a list of NumPy arrays. As the warning suggests, this can be slow, and it's recommended to first convert the list to a single NumPy array and then create a tensor.

To fix this warning, update the `states` line in the `sample` method of the `ReplayBuffer` class in `model.py`:

```python
# Original line
states = torch.tensor(states, dtype=torch.float32).to(device)

# Updated line
states = torch.tensor(np.array(states), dtype=torch.float32).to(device)
```

By converting the list of `states` to a NumPy array before creating the PyTorch tensor, you should eliminate the warning and improve the performance of this operation. Make sure to do this for all tensors created from lists of NumPy arrays in your code.

Don't forget to import NumPy at the beginning of the `model.py` file if you haven't already:

```python
import numpy as np
```
## User
There is no such line, my sample method is 

    def sample(self, batch_size):
        return random.sample(self.buffer, batch_size)
## ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. In that case, the warning may be caused by the lines in the `update` method of the `StreetFighterAgent` class in `model.py`. Let's update that method to convert the list of NumPy arrays to a single NumPy array before creating tensors.

First, make sure to import NumPy at the beginning of the `model.py` file if you haven't already:

```python
import numpy as np
```

Then, update the `update` method in the `StreetFighterAgent` class:

```python
def update(self, next_state, reward, done):
    self.memory.add(self.state, self.action, reward, next_state, done)
    
    if len(self.memory) < self.batch_size:
        return

    batch = self.memory.sample(self.batch_size)
    
    # Unpack the batch
    states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones = zip(*batch)
    
    # Convert the lists of NumPy arrays to single NumPy arrays before creating tensors
    states = torch.tensor(np.array(states), dtype=torch.float32).to(self.device)
    actions = torch.tensor(np.array(actions), dtype=torch.long).to(self.device)
    rewards = torch.tensor(np.array(rewards), dtype=torch.float32).to(self.device)
    next_states = torch.tensor(np.array(next_states), dtype=torch.float32).to(self.device)
    dones = torch.tensor(np.array(dones, dtype=np.uint8), dtype=torch.float32).to(self.device)

    # The rest of the update method remains unchanged
```

By converting the lists of NumPy arrays to single NumPy arrays before creating the tensors, you should eliminate the warning and improve the performance of this operation.
## User

## User
the speed is much better now with this fix, how can I train it in parallel? like spin off 8 processes
## ChatGPT
To train your model in parallel using multiple processes, you can use the `multiprocessing` module in Python. First, you'll need to modify your training code to be compatible with multiprocessing. Here's an outline of the steps to follow:

1. Create a function that performs the training for a single process. This function should take the process index, shared network parameters, and any other required arguments as input.
2. Initialize your shared network parameters. You can use `torch.multiprocessing.Manager` to create a shared dictionary for storing the network parameters.
3. Create a list of processes, and start each process by calling the training function with the appropriate arguments.
4. Wait for all processes to complete using the `join` method.

Here's an example of how you can implement parallel training with 8 processes:

1. In `train.py`, create a new function called `train_process`:

```python
import torch.multiprocessing as mp

def train_process(process_index, shared_network_params, other_required_args):
    # Set up your environment, agent, optimizer, etc., for this process
    # Load the shared network parameters into your agent's network

    # Training loop
    for episode in range(num_episodes):
        # Perform training steps as before

        # Occasionally update the shared network parameters with the current agent's network parameters
        if episode % update_shared_params_interval == 0:
            shared_network_params.update(agent.network.state_dict())
```

2. Initialize shared network parameters using a `Manager`:

```python
manager = mp.Manager()
shared_network_params = manager.dict(agent.network.state_dict())
```

3. Create and start the processes:

```python
processes = []
num_processes = 8

for process_index in range(num_processes):
    process = mp.Process(target=train_process, args=(process_index, shared_network_params, other_required_args))
    process.start()
    processes.append(process)
```

4. Wait for all processes to complete:

```python
for process in processes:
    process.join()
```

Make sure you replace `other_required_args` with any additional arguments needed by your `train_process` function. Also, adjust the `update_shared_params_interval` to control how often the shared network parameters are updated.

Note that parallel training might introduce additional complexity and could be harder to debug. It's essential to carefully manage shared resources and make sure the training process is stable before scaling up to multiple processes.

    process.join()
```

This script divides the total number of episodes (`num_episodes`) by the number of processes (`num_processes`) so that each process trains for an equal number of episodes. It also updates the shared network parameters every `save_every` episodes.

Please note that the `render()` function has been removed because rendering the environment slows down training and may not work correctly with multiprocessing. If you want to visualize the training progress, I recommend periodically saving the agent's model and then using a separate script to run the agent with rendering enabled.

I apologize for the oversight. It seems like you are using Windows, which requires adding `if __name__ == '__main__':` before starting the multiprocessing processes. Please update the `train.py` script with the following changes:

Replace this block:

for process_index in range(num_processes):
    process = mp.Process(target=train_process, args=(process_index, shared_network_params, device, num_episodes, save_every))

    processes.append(process)

# Wait for all processes to complete

This script should now work correctly, leveraging multiple processes to speed up the training.
## User
pool.starmap(train_process, [(process_index, device, num_episodes, save_every) for process_index in range(num_processes)])   doesn't match train_process arguments
## ChatGPT
You are correct, I apologize for the oversight. Please update the `train_process` function definition to match the arguments in the starmap call:

```python
def train_process(process_index, device, num_episodes, save_every):
```

Change it to:

```python
def train_process(process_index, num_episodes, save_every):
```

And update the following line inside the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block:

```python
pool.starmap(train_process, [(process_index, device, num_episodes, save_every) for process_index in range(num_processes)])
```

To:

```python
pool.starmap(train_process, [(process_index, num_episodes, save_every) for process_index in range(num_processes)])
```

With these changes, the script should work as expected.

fatal   : Memory allocation failure
## ChatGPT
The "Memory allocation failure" error message indicates that your system ran out of memory during the execution of the script. Training multiple agents in parallel can consume a significant amount of memory, which might exceed the available memory on your system.

To address this issue, you can try one or more of the following:

1. Reduce the number of parallel processes. In the script, you can change the `num_processes` variable to a lower value.

2. Decrease the size of the replay buffer. Lowering the buffer size will reduce memory consumption. However, it may also impact the training performance of the agent.

3. If you're using a GPU with limited memory, you might consider using CPU instead by setting the device to "cpu". Note that this may slow down the training process.

4. Close any other running applications that might be consuming a significant amount of memory.

5. Increase your system's RAM or use a machine with more memory.

Remember that finding the right balance between memory usage and training performance might require some experimentation.
## User
it doesn't seem saving the final model
## ChatGPT
I apologize for the oversight in the previous suggestions. The final model saving part was not included in the `train_process` function. You can modify the function to save the model after the training is complete for each process. Here's the updated `train_process` function:

```python
def train_process(process_index, device, num_episodes, save_every):
    # ... (previous code)

    for episode in range(num_episodes):
        # ... (previous code)

    # Save the final model for this process
    save_path = f"models/agent_process_{process_index}_final.pt"
    torch.save(agent.state_dict(), save_path)
    print(f"Process {process_index}: Saving {save_path}")
```

This will save the final model for each process after the training is complete. The model files will be named `agent_process_{process_index}_final.pt`, where `{process_index}` is the index of the process.
## User
how to save a final model after all processes are done?
## ChatGPT
To save a final model after all processes are done, you can combine the models from all processes by averaging their parameters. First, initialize a new agent and load the model weights from each process. Then, average the parameters and save the final model. Add the following code after the `pool.starmap()` call in the main script:

```python
# Combine models from all processes
combined_agent = StreetFighterAgent(observation_shape, n_actions).to(device)
num_processes = 8

# Load models and sum parameters
for process_index in range(num_processes):
    state_dict = torch.load(f"models/agent_process_{process_index}_final.pt")
    combined_agent.load_state_dict(state_dict, strict=False)

    if process_index == 0:
        combined_params = {name: param.clone() for name, param in combined_agent.named_parameters()}
    else:
        for name, param in combined_agent.named_parameters():
            combined_params[name] += param

# Average the parameters
for name in combined_params:
    combined_params[name] /= num_processes

# Update the combined agent with the averaged parameters
combined_agent.load_state_dict(combined_params)

# Save the final model
torch.save(combined_agent.state_dict(), "models/final_agent.pt")
print("Final model saved as models/final_agent.pt")
```

This code will create a new agent called `combined_agent`, load the model weights from each process, sum their parameters, average the parameters, and then save the final model as `models/final_agent.pt`.
## User
do I add this code inside context manager (with) or outside?
## ChatGPT
You should add this code outside of the context manager (i.e., outside of the `with` statement). The reason is that the context manager is used to handle the resources related to the process pool, and you want to combine the models after all processes have been completed.

Here's an example of where you can add the code:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    freeze_support()

    # Your other code ...

    with mp.Pool(processes=num_processes) as pool:
        pool.starmap(train_process, [(process_index, device, num_episodes, save_every) for process_index in range(num_processes)])

    # Combine and save the final model here
    # Add the code to combine models and save the final model after the 'with' statement
```

With this structure, the model combining and saving code will only be executed after all processes in the pool have finished their tasks.
## User
now I have it trained and got the model, could you show me play.py again?
## ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's an updated version of `play.py`:

```python
import torch
import retro
import cv2
import numpy as np
from model import StreetFighterAgent

def preprocess_state(state):
    gray_state = cv2.cvtColor(state, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)
    resized_state = cv2.resize(gray_state, (84, 84))
    return resized_state

def one_hot_encode_action(action, num_actions):
    encoded_action = np.zeros(num_actions)
    encoded_action[action] = 1
    return encoded_action

device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Create environment
env = retro.make(game='StreetFighterIISpecialChampionEdition-Genesis', state='Champion.Level1.RyuVsGuile')
state = env.reset()
preprocessed_state = preprocess_state(state)
observation_shape = (1, *preprocessed_state.shape)  # Add the channel dimension
n_actions = env.action_space.n

# Initialize agent
agent = StreetFighterAgent(observation_shape, n_actions).to(device)

# Load trained model
agent.load_state_dict(torch.load("models/agent_final.pt"))

# Play
num_episodes = 10

for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = preprocess_state(env.reset())
    state = np.expand_dims(state, axis=0)
    done = False
    total_reward = 0

    while not done:
        action = agent.act(state)
        encoded_action = one_hot_encode_action(action, n_actions)
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(encoded_action)
        env.render()

        next_state = preprocess_state(next_state)
        next_state = np.expand_dims(next_state, axis=0)
        state = next_state
        total_reward += reward

    print(f'Episode {episode + 1}, Total reward: {total_reward}')

env.close()
```

This script will load the trained model (replace "models/agent_final.pt" with the correct path to your saved model), create the environment, and play 10 episodes, showing the agent in action. You should see the agent's gameplay in a window during execution. Remember to adjust the model path to match the location of your saved model.
## User
my AI never defend or dodge the attacks
## ChatGPT
The AI's ability to defend or dodge attacks depends on the training process and the learned policy. If your agent is not performing well in these areas, there are a few potential reasons:

1. Training time: If the agent has not been trained for a sufficient number of episodes, it may not have had enough time to learn effective strategies. You can try increasing the number of episodes during training to see if the agent's performance improves.

2. Exploration vs. exploitation: The agent needs to strike a balance between exploring new actions and exploiting its current knowledge. If the agent gets stuck in suboptimal strategies, you can experiment with the exploration rate (epsilon) during training. Decrease the initial value and/or increase the decay rate of epsilon to encourage more exploration.

3. Reward function: The agent learns based on the reward it receives from the environment. If the reward function does not properly incentivize the agent to defend or dodge, it may not learn these strategies. You can try modifying the reward function to encourage the agent to defend or dodge more often.

4. Network architecture: The agent's neural network architecture may not be suitable for learning complex strategies. You can try experimenting with different architectures (e.g., adding more layers, changing the number of neurons, or using different activation functions) to improve the agent's performance.

5. Parallel training: Training multiple agents in parallel and sharing their experiences can help improve the learning process. This approach can enable the agent to explore different strategies and learn more quickly.

You can try adjusting these factors and retraining the agent to see if its performance improves. Keep in mind that reinforcement learning is an iterative process, and it can take multiple attempts to find the right combination of settings for a specific problem.
## User
I want to first change the reward function, my current agent only gets reward for game points, which only increase when it hits opponent. To win the game it needs to protect itself, then attack. another issue with my agent is that it doesn't move left or right at all
## ChatGPT
If your current reward function only considers game points from hitting the opponent, it's likely that the agent will prioritize attacking over defending or dodging. To encourage your agent to learn more defensive strategies and move left or right, you can modify the reward function to include additional components.

Here are some suggestions for modifying the reward function:

1. Defense reward: Add a positive reward when the agent successfully blocks an attack or takes reduced damage. This can be achieved by monitoring the agent's health and checking if it has decreased less than expected when an attack is blocked or dodged.

2. Positioning reward: Encourage the agent to move left or right by providing a reward based on its position relative to the opponent. For example, you can give a positive reward if the agent maintains a certain distance from the opponent or if it moves closer to the center of the screen.

3. Health difference reward: Provide a reward based on the difference in health between the agent and its opponent. This way, the agent will be incentivized to not only attack but also defend to maintain a higher health relative to the opponent.

4. Time-based penalty: Add a small penalty for every time step the agent remains idle or doesn't move left or right. This will encourage the agent to take actions that involve moving and avoiding attacks.

Here's an example of how you can combine these components in your reward function:

```
reward = 0

# Reward for game points (hitting opponent)
reward += game_points

# Defense reward
if successfully_blocked_or_dodged:
    reward += defense_reward

# Positioning reward
reward += positioning_reward(agent_position, opponent_position)

# Health difference reward
reward += health_difference_reward(agent_health, opponent_health)

# Time-based penalty
reward -= time_penalty
```

You may need to fine-tune the weights of these different components to achieve the desired behavior. It's important to experiment with different reward structures and monitor the agent's performance to find the best balance between attacking, defending, and moving left or right.
## User
can you provide the code for it instead of pseudo code?
## ChatGPT
Sure, I can provide you with a more concrete example of the reward function. However, you will need to integrate this reward function into your existing code and adapt it to work with your environment. Keep in mind that you may need to adjust the weights of the different reward components based on your observations of the agent's performance.

```python
def compute_reward(state, next_state, action):
    game_points = next_state["score"] - state["score"]
    
    # Defense reward
    damage_taken = state["agent_health"] - next_state["agent_health"]
    damage_taken_expected = 10  # Assuming an attack deals 10 points of damage
    successfully_blocked_or_dodged = damage_taken < damage_taken_expected
    defense_reward = 5 if successfully_blocked_or_dodged else 0
    
    # Positioning reward
    def positioning_reward(agent_position, opponent_position):
        distance = abs(agent_position - opponent_position)
        target_distance = 50  # Target distance between agent and opponent
        return -abs(distance - target_distance)

    positioning_reward_value = positioning_reward(state["agent_position"], state["opponent_position"])

    # Health difference reward
    health_difference = state["agent_health"] - state["opponent_health"]
    health_difference_reward = health_difference * 0.1

    # Time-based penalty
    time_penalty = -0.1

    total_reward = (
        game_points +
        defense_reward +
        positioning_reward_value +
        health_difference_reward +
        time_penalty
    )
    return total_reward
```

You'll need to extract information like `agent_health`, `opponent_health`, `agent_position`, and `opponent_position` from the environment state. This will depend on how the environment provides the state information. Also, adjust the constants in the reward function based on your specific game and agent.
## User
how do I call this function? or where do I call it?
## ChatGPT
You should call the `compute_reward` function inside the main training loop, after you receive the `next_state` from the environment. You'll need to modify your current code to use the custom reward function instead of the default reward provided by the environment.

Here's an example of how to call the `compute_reward` function in your training loop:

```python
# In your main training loop
while not done:
    action = agent.act(state)
    encoded_action = one_hot_encode_action(action, n_actions)
    next_state, env_reward, done, info = env.step(encoded_action)

    # Extract the required information from the state and next_state
    state_info = extract_info_from_state(state)
    next_state_info = extract_info_from_state(next_state)

    custom_reward = compute_reward(state_info, next_state_info, action)

    next_state = preprocess_state(next_state)
    next_state = np.expand_dims(next_state, axis=0)

    replay_buffer.push(state, action, custom_reward, next_state, done)

    state = next_state

    if len(replay_buffer) > batch_size:
        batch = replay_buffer.sample(batch_size)
        agent.update(batch, optimizer, target_network, device)
```

You'll need to create the `extract_info_from_state` function, which extracts the required information (`agent_health`, `opponent_health`, `agent_position`, and `opponent_position`) from the environment state. The implementation of this function will depend on the structure of the state provided by your environment.

Once you've made these changes, your agent should start learning from the custom reward function, and its behavior should adapt accordingly.
## User
can you provide extract_info_from_state  function as well?
## ChatGPT
I am not able to provide a precise implementation of the `extract_info_from_state` function without knowing the structure of the environment state and how the required information is stored in it. However, I can give you a template that you can fill in with the appropriate code to extract the required information:

```python
def extract_info_from_state(state):
    # Assuming the state is an image, you might need to use
    # computer vision techniques to extract the required information.
    # If the information is readily available in the state, you can
    # simply extract it directly.

    # Replace the following lines with your implementation
    agent_health = 0
    opponent_health = 0
    agent_position = 0
    opponent_position = 0

    # Return the extracted information as a tuple
    return agent_health, opponent_health, agent_position, opponent_position
```

You will need to replace the placeholder lines (the ones that assign `0` to each variable) with the appropriate code to extract the required information from the state. If the information is available directly in the state (e.g., as attributes or specific values in a structured object), you can simply extract it and assign it to the corresponding variables. If the state is an image and you need to use computer vision techniques to extract the information, you might need to use a library like OpenCV to process the image and locate the relevant objects (such as the health bars and character positions).
## User
state = preprocess_state(env.reset()), can you get the structure of state and provide extract_info_from_state?
## ChatGPT
As `preprocess_state` is a custom function you provided earlier, I cannot directly access its output or the state of your specific environment. However, I can help you create a modified version of `preprocess_state` that returns the required information as well as the preprocessed state. Here's an example:

```python
def preprocess_state_and_extract_info(state):
    gray_state = cv2.cvtColor(state, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)
    resized_state = cv2.resize(gray_state, (84, 84))

    # Extract the required information from the original (unprocessed) state
    # Here, you should replace the following lines with your own implementation
    agent_health = 0
    opponent_health = 0
    agent_position = 0
    opponent_position = 0

    return resized_state, agent_health, opponent_health, agent_position, opponent_position
```

In this modified version of the function, I've added lines to extract the required information from the original state before preprocessing it. You will need to replace the placeholder lines (the ones that assign `0` to each variable) with the appropriate code to extract the required information from the state.

After modifying the function, you can update the line where you call it in your main training loop:

```python
state, agent_health, opponent_health, agent_position, opponent_position = preprocess_state_and_extract_info(env.reset())
```

This will give you the preprocessed state as well as the extracted information. Then, you can pass this information to the `compute_custom_reward` function to calculate the custom reward.
## User
I don't know how to extra these info from state
## ChatGPT
To extract information such as agent health, opponent health, agent position, and opponent position from the game state, you need to understand the structure of the state and how it represents these values. In most cases, this information can be found in the game's RAM or the memory used by the game. Accessing this information requires knowledge of the specific game's memory layout and addresses where these values are stored.

For Street Fighter II on Sega Genesis, I do not have the exact memory addresses for these values. However, you can follow these general steps to find the memory addresses and extract the required information:

1. Research the memory layout of Street Fighter II on Sega Genesis to find the memory addresses for agent health, opponent health, agent position, and opponent position.

2. Use Retro's `env.get_ram()` function to access the game's RAM during the training loop. This will return a NumPy array containing the game's memory.

3. Index the NumPy array with the memory addresses you found in step 1 to get the values for agent health, opponent health, agent position, and opponent position.

4. Pass these values to the `compute_custom_reward` function to calculate the custom reward based on the extracted information.

For example, once you have found the correct memory addresses, you can update the `preprocess_state_and_extract_info` function like this:

```python
def preprocess_state_and_extract_info(state, env):
    gray_state = cv2.cvtColor(state, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)
    resized_state = cv2.resize(gray_state, (84, 84))

    # Access the game's RAM
    ram = env.get_ram()

    # Replace the following lines with the correct memory addresses
    agent_health_address = 0x0000
    opponent_health_address = 0x0001
    agent_position_address = 0x0002
    opponent_position_address = 0x0003

    # Extract the required information from the RAM
    agent_health = ram[agent_health_address]
    opponent_health = ram[opponent_health_address]
    agent_position = ram[agent_position_address]
    opponent_position = ram[opponent_position_address]

    return resized_state, agent_health, opponent_health, agent_position, opponent_position
```

In this example, you need to replace the memory addresses (0x0000, 0x0001, 0x0002, 0x0003) with the correct addresses for the specific values you want to extract. Note that the actual memory addresses might not be single bytes, and you might need to combine multiple bytes to get the correct values.

Please note that finding the correct memory addresses and understanding the game's memory layout can be a complex task and might require significant research and experimentation.
## User
how exactly do I do step 1?
## ChatGPT
Step 1 involves researching the memory layout of Street Fighter II on Sega Genesis to find the memory addresses for agent health, opponent health, agent position, and opponent position. To achieve this, you can follow these approaches:

1. Online Research: Search online for information about the memory layout of the game. There are communities, forums, and websites dedicated to game reverse engineering and hacking, where you might find the required memory addresses or information on how to find them. Some popular forums include:

    - Romhacking.net (https://www.romhacking.net/)
    - NesDev Forums (https://forums.nesdev.com/)

    You can search these forums or ask questions to get help with finding the memory addresses you need.

2. Use a memory editor or debugger: Memory editors and debuggers allow you to view and manipulate the memory of a running game. You can use these tools to find the memory addresses that store the information you need.

    - For the Sega Genesis, a popular emulator with debugging capabilities is Gens KMod (https://segaretro.org/Gens_KMod). This emulator allows you to view the memory and set breakpoints/watchpoints to understand how the game updates the memory.
    - Another option is the BizHawk emulator (http://tasvideos.org/BizHawk.html), which has debugging capabilities for several platforms, including the Sega Genesis.

    To use these tools, you need to run the game in the emulator and monitor the memory while playing. Look for memory addresses that change when the agent's health, opponent's health, agent position, or opponent position change. It might require trial and error and a good understanding of the game mechanics to find the correct memory addresses.

3. Analyze the game's ROM: Analyzing the game's ROM is an advanced approach that requires reverse engineering the game's code to understand how it manages memory. This method requires a good understanding of assembly language and reverse engineering techniques. You can use disassemblers and debuggers like IDA Pro, Ghidra, or Radare2 to analyze the game's ROM and find the memory addresses you need. This approach is more time-consuming and complex, and it's usually the last resort if you cannot find the information you need through other methods.

Once you find the correct memory addresses for the information you need, you can use them in your code to access the game's RAM and extract the required information, as explained in the previous answer.
## User
I thought you are the ai who can help me do the search and tell me the result
## ChatGPT
I apologize for any confusion. As an AI language model, I cannot directly search the web or interact with external resources like forums or other web pages. My knowledge is based on the training data up to September 2021, and I can only provide general guidance on how to perform certain tasks.

In this case, I recommend you to follow the mentioned approaches to find the memory addresses needed for your custom reward function. You can try searching the forums I mentioned earlier, or use emulators with debugging capabilities to find the information yourself. Unfortunately, I cannot directly provide you with the memory addresses, as I cannot perform web searches or interact with external resources.
## User
is there a way to train my model without knowing these?
## ChatGPT
Yes, you can train your model without a custom reward function based on memory addresses. The model will still learn from the default rewards provided by the game environment, but it may not be as efficient or effective in learning specific behaviors like defending or dodging.

Here are a few general suggestions to improve the learning process without using a custom reward function:

1. Exploration: Encourage exploration in the early stages of training to ensure that the agent tries a wide range of actions. You can use an epsilon-greedy strategy with a decay rate for epsilon to gradually shift from exploration to exploitation.

2. Longer training: Allow the model to train for more episodes to give it more chances to discover and learn optimal strategies.

3. Reward shaping: If you cannot access the memory addresses, you can still try to incorporate other heuristics into the reward function. For example, you can provide a small positive reward for moving towards the opponent or for successfully blocking an attack. This might require some trial and error to fine-tune the reward values.

4. Curriculum learning: Start with simpler tasks and gradually increase the difficulty. For example, you could begin with a stationary opponent and then move on to an opponent that only uses basic attacks.

Keep in mind that these suggestions may not directly address the specific issues you mentioned (i.e., defending and dodging), but they might help improve the overall learning process and could potentially lead to better performance.
## User
I found that someone else can use stable-baselines3 to train
## ChatGPT
Yes, Stable-Baselines3 is a popular library for reinforcement learning that provides a clean and easy-to-use implementation of various state-of-the-art algorithms. You can use this library to train your Street Fighter II agent as well. Here's a simple example of how to use Stable-Baselines3 with your existing environment:

1. First, you'll need to install Stable-Baselines3:

```bash
pip install stable-baselines3
```

2. Then, you can modify your training script to use Stable-Baselines3:

```python
import retro
from stable_baselines3 import PPO
from stable_baselines3.common.vec_env import DummyVecEnv

def main():
    # Create the environment
    env = retro.make(game='StreetFighterIISpecialChampionEdition-Genesis', state='Champion.Level1.RyuVsGuile')
    env = DummyVecEnv([lambda: env])  # The algorithms require a vectorized environment to run

    # Instantiate the agent
    model = PPO("CnnPolicy", env, verbose=1)

    # Train the agent
    model.learn(total_timesteps=200000)

    # Save the trained agent
    model.save("ppo_sf2")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this example, we're using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, which is a popular choice for training policies in various domains. You can experiment with other algorithms provided by Stable-Baselines3, such as DDPG, TD3, or SAC, to see if they work better for your specific problem.

Note that this example assumes you've already set up the environment and installed the necessary dependencies. You can adjust the training parameters (e.g., total_timesteps) to control the length of the training process.

Keep in mind that you may still need to preprocess the state and customize the reward function, as discussed in previous messages, to achieve optimal performance. Stable-Baselines3 allows you to create custom environments by subclassing `gym.Env`, which can help you implement these customizations more easily.
## User
let's start all over again with stable-baselines3.
Please start with setting up the environment with pytorch with GPU support, make sure specify version of each package
## ChatGPT
Sure, let's start by setting up the environment with PyTorch and Stable-Baselines3. I'll provide a list of packages and their versions for you to install. You can install these packages in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects.

1. First, create a new virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv my_sf2_ai_env
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

For Linux or macOS:

```bash
source my_sf2_ai_env/bin/activate
```

For Windows:

```bash
my_sf2_ai_env\Scripts\activate
```

3. Now, install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install torch==1.9.1+cu111 torchvision==0.10.1+cu111 torchaudio==0.9.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu111/torch_stable.html

Now I have imported the game rom, setup the venv. Please provide code to train my model (on GPU), please separate code to 3 files, model.py, train.py and play.py
## ChatGPT
I'll provide you with the code for `model.py`, `train.py`, and `play.py` to train and play your Street Fighter II game using stable-baselines3. Make sure you've installed stable-baselines3 and gym-retro using pip.

**model.py:**
```python
import torch
from stable_baselines3 import PPO
from stable_baselines3.common.vec_env import DummyVecEnv
from stable_baselines3.common.torch_layers import BaseFeaturesExtractor
import gym
import gym_retro

    def __init__(self, observation_space: gym.spaces.Box):
        super().__init__(observation_space, features_dim=512)
        self.cnn = torch.nn.Sequential(
            torch.nn.Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=8, stride=4, padding=0),
            torch.nn.ReLU(),
            torch.nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=0),
            torch.nn.ReLU(),
            torch.nn.Conv2d(64, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=0),

            torch.nn.Linear(3136, 512),
            torch.nn.ReLU()
        )

    def forward(self, observations: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        return self.cnn(observations)
```

Make sure to replace `"your_roms_path_here
## User
continue
## ChatGPT
Make sure to replace `"your_roms_path_here"` with the path to your ROMs directory in both `train.py` and `play.py`.

To train the model, run `train.py`. This will train the model using PPO and save the trained model as `street_fighter_ppo.zip`.

Once the training is complete, you can run the `play.py` script to see the agent play the game. The agent will use the trained model to make decisions in the game.

Keep in mind that the training process might take a while, depending on the number of timesteps you choose to train for and your hardware. You can adjust the total number of timesteps in the `train.py` script by changing the `total_timesteps` parameter in the `model.learn()` function.

Note that the provided code assumes you have a GPU available for training. If you do not have a GPU, you can change the `device` parameter to `'cpu'` in both `train.py` and `play.py` scripts.
## User
can you render the training process?
## ChatGPT
Yes, you can render the training process by adding a `callback` function to the `PPO` model's `learn()` method in `train.py`. The callback function will be called at every environment step during training, allowing you to render the environment as the agent trains.

First, define the `render_callback` function above the `train_agent` function in `train.py`:

```python
def render_callback(local_vars, global_vars):
    local_vars['self'].env.render()
```

Then, modify the `train_agent` function to pass the `render_callback` as the `callback` parameter to the `learn()` method:

```python
def train_agent(env_id, total_timesteps, model_save_path):
    # Create the environment
    env = gym.make(env_id)

    # Create the PPO model
    model = PPO("CnnPolicy", env, verbose=1, device=device)

    # Train the model
    model.learn(total_timesteps=total_timesteps, callback=render_callback)

    # Save the model
    model.save(model_save_path)
```

With these changes, the training process will be rendered. Note that rendering the training process will likely slow down the training, so you might want to remove the callback or render less frequently if training speed is a concern.

Apologies for the confusion. It seems there is a mistake in the `policy_kwargs` dictionary. We should pass the custom `features_extractor_class` as a keyword argument instead of using a tuple. Please update the `policy_kwargs` in `train.py` like this:

```python
policy_kwargs = {
    "features_extractor_class": CustomCnn,
    "features_extractor_kwargs": {"features_dim": 128},

This should fix the error you encountered.

I apologize for the confusion earlier. It seems I made a mistake in the `CustomCNN` class definition. In the constructor, you should replace `features_dim` with `feature_dim` to match the argument name in the `policy_kwargs` dictionary.

Here's the corrected `CustomCNN` class definition in `model.py`:

are you changing the CustonCNN parent class?
## ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. My previous response was incorrect. The issue lies in the `CustomCNN` class definition. I provided an incorrect signature for the `__init__` method. 

Please update the `CustomCNN` class definition in `model.py` as follows:

```python
class CustomCNN(BaseFeaturesExtractor):
    def __init__(self, observation_space: gym.spaces.Box, feature_dim: int = 128):
        super().__init__(observation_space, feature_dim)
        self.cnn = torch.nn.Sequential(
            torch.nn.Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=8, stride=4, padding=0),
            torch.nn.ReLU(),
            torch.nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=0),
            torch.nn.ReLU(),
            torch.nn.Conv2d(64, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=0),

        )

    def forward(self, observations: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:

```

With this change, the `CustomCNN` class should work correctly with the provided `train.py` script.

## ChatGPT
Apologies for the confusion, it appears the shape of the input data doesn't match the expected shape of the custom CNN. This is because different environments might have different observation shapes.

To fix this issue, you can modify the `CustomCNN` class to dynamically calculate the input shape of the linear layer based on the input observation shape. Update the `CustomCNN` class in `model.py` as follows:

```python
class CustomCNN(BaseFeaturesExtractor):
    def __init__(self, observation_space: gym.spaces.Box, feature_dim: int = 128):
        super().__init__(observation_space, feature_dim)
        self.cnn = torch.nn.Sequential(
            torch.nn.Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=8, stride=4, padding=0),
            torch.nn.ReLU(),
            torch.nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=0),
            torch.nn.ReLU(),
            torch.nn.Conv2d(64, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=0),
            torch.nn.ReLU(),
            torch.nn.Flatten()
        )

        # Calculate the output shape of the CNN by doing a forward pass with a dummy input
        with torch.no_grad():
            dummy_input = torch.zeros(1, *observation_space.shape)
            cnn_output_shape = self.cnn(dummy_input).shape[-1]

        self.linear = torch.nn.Sequential(
            torch.nn.Linear(cnn_output_shape, feature_dim),
            torch.nn.ReLU()
        )

    def forward(self, observations: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        features = self.cnn(observations)
        return self.linear(features)
```

This will calculate the shape of the linear layer input based on the actual shape of the observations in the given environment, and it should fix the error you're encountering.
## User
Now the training starts and I can see it rendered. How can I speed up the training? like train it in parallel
## ChatGPT
To speed up the training, you can use a vectorized environment to run multiple environments in parallel. This can be done using `SubprocVecEnv` from Stable Baselines 3.

Here's how you can modify your `train.py` script to use a vectorized environment:

```python
import os
from model import CustomCNN, PPO
from stable_baselines3.common.vec_env import DummyVecEnv, SubprocVecEnv
import retro

def render_callback(local_vars, global_vars):
    local_vars['self'].env.render()

def make_env(env_id, state):
    def _init():
        env = retro.make(game=env_id, state=state)
        return env
    return _init

def main():
    env_id = "StreetFighterIISpecialChampionEdition-Genesis"
    state = "Champion.Level1.RyuVsGuile"
    model_path = 'models/sf2_model'

    num_envs = 8  # Number of environments to run in parallel

    # Create a vectorized environment with multiple parallel environments
    env = SubprocVecEnv([make_env(env_id, state) for _ in range(num_envs)])

    policy_kwargs = {
        "features_extractor_class": CustomCNN,
        "features_extractor_kwargs": {"feature_dim": 128},
    }

    model = PPO("CnnPolicy", env, policy_kwargs=policy_kwargs, verbose=1, device='cuda')
    model.learn(total_timesteps=int(1e6), callback=render_callback)

    model.save(model_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This will create 8 environments running in parallel. You can adjust the `num_envs` variable according to your hardware capabilities. Keep in mind that running more environments might require more memory.

Please note that rendering in this setup might not work as expected because the render function is not designed to work with `SubprocVecEnv`. To monitor the training progress, you can use TensorBoard instead.

Could you explain what each item means? Please try to explain with simple terms that high school students can understand
## ChatGPT
Sure, here's an explanation of each item in the output:

1. **fps**: Frames per second. It shows how many environment steps are being processed per second. The higher the value, the faster your training is running.
2. **iterations**: The number of iterations that have been completed. Each iteration consists of data collection, training the model, and updating the model parameters.
3. **time_elapsed**: The total time elapsed, in seconds, since the start of the training.
4. **total_timesteps**: The total number of environment steps taken during the training so far.
5. **approx_kl**: Approximate KL divergence. It is a measure of how much the policy has changed during an update. If it's too large, it means the policy is changing too much, which might harm learning.
6. **clip_fraction**: The fraction of the gradients that were clipped during training. Clipping is a technique used in PPO to stabilize the learning process by preventing the gradients from becoming too large.
7. **clip_range**: The range of the gradients that are allowed before they are clipped. This value is usually kept constant during training.
8. **entropy_loss**: A measure of the randomness in the policy's action distribution. Encouraging exploration by having a higher entropy can help the agent find better strategies.
9. **explained_variance**: A measure of how well the value function is predicting the returns. A value of 1 means perfect prediction, while a value of 0 means the prediction is no better than just using the mean.
10. **learning_rate**: The step size used during the optimization process. It controls how much the model parameters are updated based on the gradients.
11. **loss**: The overall loss value used to update the model parameters.
12. **n_updates**: The total number of times the model parameters have been updated.
13. **policy_gradient_loss**: The loss value associated with the policy update, which is responsible for improving the agent's action selection.
14. **value_loss**: The loss value associated with the value function, which estimates the expected return from a given state.

These values can help you monitor the training process and diagnose potential issues. For example, if the loss is not decreasing over time, it may indicate that the learning rate is too high or that the model is not learning properly.
## User
the loss is fluctuate widely, from 20 to 6.12e+05  , and it doesn't seem converging after 95 iterations
## ChatGPT
Fluctuations in the loss value during training can be quite common, especially in the early stages of training. However, if the loss value continues to fluctuate significantly after many iterations and does not seem to converge, there might be some issues with the training process. Here are a few suggestions to address this:

1. **Adjust the learning rate**: A high learning rate might cause the loss to fluctuate or even diverge, while a low learning rate might result in slower convergence. Experiment with different learning rates to find the one that works best for your problem.

2. **Clip range**: The clip range used in PPO can impact the training stability. You can try adjusting the clip range to see if it improves the convergence of the loss.

3. **Training duration**: Sometimes, the training might require more iterations to converge. You can try increasing the total number of timesteps or iterations to see if the model eventually converges.

4. **Tune other hyperparameters**: There are many hyperparameters in the PPO algorithm that can impact training performance, such as the number of epochs, batch size, and the discount factor. Experimenting with different hyperparameter settings might help you find a combination that leads to better convergence.

5. **Model architecture**: The choice of the model architecture can also affect the training performance. You can try adjusting the architecture of your custom CNN (e.g., the number of layers or the number of filters) to see if it improves the convergence.

Remember that reinforcement learning can be quite sensitive to hyperparameters and other settings, so it's important to experiment and iterate on your approach to find the best configuration for your problem.
## User
by reading the output values, how do I know whether it is going on a right direction, or how to tell whether the model is working well? What kind of values should I expect after 100 iterations? To get an OK model, how many iteration it usually takes?
## ChatGPT
In reinforcement learning, it can be challenging to determine if a model is learning well just by looking at the training output values. However, there are some indicators that you can use to get a general sense of whether the training is going in the right direction:

1. **Decreasing loss**: Ideally, the loss values should decrease over time, indicating that the model is learning to approximate the value function and policy better. If the loss value is fluctuating too much or increasing, it may be an indication of an issue with the training process.

2. **Increasing explained variance**: Explained variance is a measure of how well the value function approximates the actual returns. A higher explained variance (closer to 1) means that the value function is doing a better job of approximating the returns.

3. **Entropy loss**: Entropy loss is a measure of the randomness in the policy. Higher entropy can encourage exploration, while lower entropy can lead to more deterministic policies. Ideally, you want the entropy loss to decrease over time, indicating that the model is becoming more confident in its actions.

However, it is important to note that these metrics can be noisy, and it is not always easy to draw conclusions based on them. The best way to evaluate the performance of a reinforcement learning model is by observing its actual performance in the environment.

Regarding the number of iterations needed to get an OK model, this can vary significantly depending on the complexity of the problem, the architecture of the model, and the choice of hyperparameters. For some problems, a few hundred iterations might be enough, while for more complex problems, it may take thousands or even millions of iterations.

It is recommended to periodically test the trained model in the environment to get a sense of its performance. If the agent performs well in the environment, it's a good indication that the training is progressing well.
## User
once current training completes, I get a model file. Let's say I use it to play the game then come back to tweak the training. How can I use the saved model to continue training with updated parameters instead of starting over from scratch?
## ChatGPT
You can load the saved model and continue training with the updated parameters. First, you need to load the saved model using the `PPO.load()` method. Then, update the parameters as needed, and finally, call the `learn()` method again to continue training. Here's an example:

```python
from model import CustomCNN, PPO
from stable_baselines3.common.vec_env import DummyVecEnv
import retro

def main():
    env_id = "StreetFighterIISpecialChampionEdition-Genesis"
    state = "Champion.Level1.RyuVsGuile"
    model_path = 'models/sf2_model'

    env = retro.make(game=env_id, state=state)
    env = DummyVecEnv([lambda: env])

    # Load the saved model
    model = PPO.load(model_path, env)

    # Update the parameters as needed
    model.learning_rate = 0.0001  # Just an example, set the new learning rate or any other parameter

    policy_kwargs = {
        "features_extractor_class": CustomCNN,
        "features_extractor_kwargs": {"features_dim": 128},
    }

    # Replace the policy_kwargs with the updated parameters
    model.policy_kwargs = policy_kwargs

    # Re-setup the model to apply the changes
    model._setup_model()

    # Continue training
    model.learn(total_timesteps=int(1e6), callback=render_callback)

    # Save the model again after training
    model.save(model_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this example, the `PPO.load()` method loads the saved model, and the parameters are updated accordingly. Note that you will need to call `_setup_model()` after updating the parameters to apply the changes. Then you can continue training with the `learn()` method and save the updated model once the training is completed.
## User
does rendering training process lower training speed? If so, how much slower? Can you give a rough estimate in percentage?
## ChatGPT
Yes, rendering the training process can slow down the training speed, as it adds the overhead of visualizing the environment at each step. The exact slowdown percentage is difficult to estimate, as it depends on various factors, including the environment, the complexity of the game, the hardware you are running the training on, and the rendering settings.

However, it's not uncommon to see slowdowns in the range of 10-50% or more. If you want to speed up the training, you can consider disabling or limiting the frequency of rendering during the training process. For instance, you can render only every N steps or render a few episodes during the training process to get an idea of how the agent is performing.
## User
Let me tell you the environment so you can have better idea. I am using Windows10 22H2, CPU is Ryzen 5 5600, RAM is 16GB DDR4 3600MHz, GPU is RTX3080 10GB, hard drive is a PCIE3.0 NVME SSD. Now, could you give me an estimate how much slower it will be if I render the process
## ChatGPT
Given your hardware specifications, it's still challenging to provide a precise estimate of the slowdown caused by rendering. It highly depends on the specific environment, game complexity, and the rendering settings themselves.

However, with your hardware setup, I'd expect the slowdown to be less pronounced than on less powerful systems. A rough estimate would be a slowdown in the range of 10-30%. Keep in mind that this is only a rough estimate and may not be fully accurate for your specific situation.

If you want to minimize the impact on training speed, you can consider limiting the frequency of rendering, such as rendering only every N steps or rendering a few episodes during the training process to get an idea of how the agent is performing.
## User
how do I render once every 10 iterations? I assume "iteration" means "playing the game from start to where got defeated", if meaning of iteration is otherwise, please let me knwo
## ChatGPT
An iteration in PPO training usually refers to a set of steps collected in the environment before an update is performed, but not necessarily a full episode. In the case of Stable-Baselines3, an iteration consists of the number of steps specified by the `n_steps` parameter (default is 2048 steps) when creating the PPO model.

To render every 10 iterations, you can modify the `render_callback` function to check the current iteration number and render accordingly. Here's an example:

```python
def render_callback(local_vars, global_vars):
    if local_vars['n_updates'] % 10 == 0:
        local_vars['self'].env.render()
```

In your `train.py` script, when calling the `learn()` method, pass the `render_callback` as the callback function:

```python
model.learn(total_timesteps=int(1e6), callback=render_callback)
```

This will render the environment every 10 iterations of training. Note that this will not render every 10 episodes but rather every 10 updates of the PPO algorithm.
## User
what do episode mean? is it "playing the game from start to where got defeated", if so, how can I render once every 10 episodes and the rendering should render the complete episode
## ChatGPT
Yes, an episode usually refers to a complete playthrough of the game from the start until a terminal condition is reached, such as getting defeated, winning, or reaching a time limit.

To render every 10 episodes, you can create a custom callback that will keep track of the number of episodes and render the environment accordingly. Here's an example of how to do this:

First, create a custom callback class in your `train.py`:

```python
from stable_baselines3.common.callbacks import BaseCallback

class RenderEveryTenEpisodesCallback(BaseCallback):
    def __init__(self, check_freq: int):
        super(RenderEveryTenEpisodesCallback, self).__init__()
        self.check_freq = check_freq
        self.episode_counter = 0
        self.should_render = False

    def _on_step(self) -> bool:
        if self.training_env.envs[0].game_over():
            self.episode_counter += 1
            self.training_env.envs[0].reset()
            if self.episode_counter % self.check_freq == 0:
                self.should_render = True
            else:
                self.should_render = False

        if self.should_render:
            self.training_env.envs[0].render()

        return True
```

Then, in your `main()` function in `train.py`, create an instance of the custom callback and pass it to the `learn()` method:

```python
callback = RenderEveryTenEpisodesCallback(check_freq=10)
model.learn(total_timesteps=int(1e6), callback=callback)
```

This will render the environment for the entire episode every 10 episodes during training.

TypeError: __init__() got multiple values for argument 'observation_space'

Process finished with exit code 1
## ChatGPT
The error is caused by the way `features_extractor_kwargs` is passed. In `play.py`, you should change the `policy_kwargs` definition to this:

```python
policy_kwargs = dict(
    features_extractor_class=CustomCNN,
    features_extractor_kwargs=dict(features_dim=512),
)
```

This is because the `observation_space` is automatically passed to the `CustomCNN` when initializing the model, so you don't need to include it in the `features_extractor_kwargs`.

After making this change, your `play.py` should run without issues.
## User
well, during training, feature_dim=128, why do we use 512 during playing? Should these 2 be identical, or they are unrelated?
## ChatGPT
You're right, my mistake. The `features_dim` should be consistent between training and playing. In both cases, it should be set to the same value, which is 128 in your case. Here's the corrected `policy_kwargs`:

```python
policy_kwargs = dict(
    features_extractor_class=CustomCNN,
    features_extractor_kwargs=dict(features_dim=128),
)
```

Make sure to use the same value for `features_dim` during training and playing to ensure compatibility between the saved model and the model used for playing.
## User
I played with the trained model, it is pretty bad. It doesn't seem to know how to defend or dodge opponent attacks, only constantly attacking, how should I improve it? And to be honest, the trained model (after 100+ iterations) looks no better than the first iteration
## ChatGPT
Improving the performance of a reinforcement learning agent can be challenging, as it depends on various factors such as the quality of the training data, the choice of hyperparameters, and the complexity of the environment. Here are a few suggestions to improve your agent's performance:

1. Train for more iterations: Training an agent to perform well in complex environments like Street Fighter II can take a significant number of iterations. 100+ iterations might not be enough for the agent to learn effective strategies. You may need to train the agent for thousands or even millions of timesteps to see improvements.

2. Optimize hyperparameters: Experiment with different hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, discount factor (gamma), and others. You can use techniques like grid search or random search to find the best hyperparameters for your problem.

3. Reward shaping: The agent's performance depends heavily on the reward signal it receives from the environment. You can try to modify the reward function to provide more informative feedback to the agent, such as giving additional rewards for successful dodges or blocks.

4. Curriculum learning: Start with simpler tasks or opponents and gradually increase the difficulty as the agent improves. This can help the agent learn basic skills more effectively before tackling more complex challenges.

5. Use a pre-trained model: You can start with a pre-trained model that has already learned some useful features from a similar environment or task, and fine-tune it for your specific problem.

6. Add exploration: Encourage the agent to explore different actions by using techniques like epsilon-greedy exploration or adding an entropy bonus to the loss function.

Keep in mind that reinforcement learning can be sample-inefficient and may require a large number of training iterations to achieve good performance. Patience and experimentation are key to success in this field.
## User
how to achieve Reward shaping? please provide detail code
## ChatGPT
Reward shaping involves modifying the reward function to provide more informative feedback to the agent, encouraging it to learn desired behaviors. To implement reward shaping in your specific problem, you will need to create a custom environment that inherits from the `retro.RetroEnv` class and overrides the `step()` function to modify the reward signal.

Here's a basic example of how you could create a custom environment to implement reward shaping:

1. Create a new file called `custom_sf2_env.py` and put the following code:

```python
import retro
import numpy as np

class CustomSF2Env(retro.RetroEnv):
    def __init__(self, game, state, scenario=None, info=None, use_restricted_actions=retro.Actions.FILTERED, *args, **kwargs):
        super(CustomSF2Env, self).__init__(game, state, scenario, info, use_restricted_actions, *args, **kwargs)

    def step(self, action):
        obs, reward, done, info = super(CustomSF2Env, self).step(action)
        shaped_reward = self.shape_reward(reward, info)
        return obs, shaped_reward, done, info

    def shape_reward(self, reward, info):
        shaped_reward = reward

        # Add your reward shaping logic here
        # Example: Increase reward if the opponent's health decreases
        # shaped_reward += (info["enemy_health_prev"] - info["enemy_health"])

        return shaped_reward
```

2. Modify your `train.py` and `play.py` files to use the custom environment:

```python
from custom_sf2_env import CustomSF2Env

def main():
    env_id = "StreetFighterIISpecialChampionEdition-Genesis"
    state = "Champion.Level1.RyuVsGuile"

    env = CustomSF2Env(game=env_id, state=state)
    # ... rest of the code
```

In the `shape_reward` method of `CustomSF2Env`, you can add your own reward shaping logic based on the `info` dictionary provided by the environment. For example, you could give the agent an additional reward for reducing the opponent's health, as shown in the commented line of code.

Make sure to adjust the reward shaping logic to match the specific requirements of your problem and the information available in the `info` dictionary. You might need to experiment with different reward shaping strategies to find one that leads to better learning.
## User
what data type is reward returned by step()? What is typical value range? How do I determine custom reward is appropriate not excessive? What keys are available in "info" dict and what data types are they?
## ChatGPT
In the `retro.RetroEnv` environment, the `reward` returned by the `step()` function is a floating-point number. The range of reward values can vary depending on the game and scenario, but it's typically normalized to be between -1 and 1 or 0 and 1. You can also check the specific reward range by inspecting the `reward_range` attribute of the environment (e.g., `env.reward_range`).

When determining if a custom reward is appropriate, you should consider the following guidelines:

1. Keep the reward values in a similar range to the original rewards, such that the custom rewards do not excessively dominate the learning signal.
2. The reward function should be easy for the agent to optimize, meaning that the agent should be able to understand how its actions are affecting the rewards it receives.
3. The reward function should encourage the agent to learn the desired behavior, so make sure the custom reward is based on meaningful aspects of the game state.

The `info` dictionary contains information about the current state of the game, such as the agent's health, the opponent's health, and other game-specific variables. The keys and data types in the `info` dictionary depend on the specific game and how the environment is set up.

In the case of "Street Fighter II", some of the keys you can find in the `info` dictionary include:

- `'health'`: Integer representing the agent's health.
- `'enemy_health'`: Integer representing the opponent's health.
- `'match_round'`: Integer representing the current round number.
- `'match_wins'`: Integer representing the number of rounds won by the agent.
- `'enemy_match_wins'`: Integer representing the number of rounds won by the opponent.

These are just a few examples. You can inspect the full set of keys and their respective data types by printing the `info` dictionary during training or playing, like this:

```python
print(info)
```

Keep in mind that the specific keys and data types may vary depending on the game and the state being used.

AttributeError: 'SubprocVecEnv' object has no attribute 'envs'
## ChatGPT
The issue here is that `SubprocVecEnv` does not have an attribute named `envs`. Instead, you can use `get_attr` method to access the attributes of the environments inside the `SubprocVecEnv`. Here's how you can modify the `_on_step` method in the `RenderEveryTenEpisodesCallback` class to fix the issue:

```python
class RenderEveryTenEpisodesCallback(BaseCallback):
    def __init__(self, check_freq: int):
        super(RenderEveryTenEpisodesCallback, self).__init__()
        self.check_freq = check_freq
        self.episode_counter = 0
        self.should_render = False

    def _on_step(self) -> bool:
        game_over = self.training_env.get_attr('game_over')[0]
        if game_over:
            self.episode_counter += 1
            self.training_env.env_method('reset', indices=[0])
            if self.episode_counter % self.check_freq == 0:
                self.should_render = True
            else:
                self.should_render = False

        if self.should_render:
            self.training_env.env_method('render', indices=[0])

        return True
```

In the `_on_step` method, I replaced the access to the `envs` attribute with `get_attr` and `env_method` calls. The `get_attr` method retrieves the value of an attribute (in this case, `game_over`) from each environment, and the `env_method` method calls a method (in this case, `reset` and `render`) on the specified environments (indicated by the `indices` parameter).

It seems like the `CustomSF2Env` does not have the attribute `game_over`. You should add a `game_over` property to your `CustomSF2Env` class to fix this issue. This property should return `True` when the game is over and `False` otherwise. Here's a simple example of how you can add this property:

```python
class CustomSF2Env(retro.RetroEnv):
    # ... rest of your CustomSF2Env implementation ...

    @property
    def game_over(self):
        return self.done
```

In this example, I assume that you have a `done` attribute in your `CustomSF2Env` class that represents whether the game is over or not. If you have a different way of determining if the game is over, you should modify the `game_over` property accordingly.
## User
it seems that custom reward is working, how can I train it against the final opponent directly? I don't want to start from beginning every time game overs
## ChatGPT
To train your model against the final opponent directly, you'll need to change the environment's initial state to start at the final opponent level. This can be done by changing the `state` variable in your `train.py` script.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Identify the appropriate state string corresponding to the final opponent level. The state string has the format "Champion.LevelX.Characters" where X is the level number and "Characters" represent the fighters.
2. Replace the current state string in the `train.py` script with the one corresponding to the final opponent level.

For example, if the final opponent is in Level 12, and you want to play as Ryu against M.Bison, the state string would be `"Champion.Level12.RyuVsMBison"`. Update the `state` variable in your `train.py` script as follows:

```python
state = "Champion.Level12.RyuVsMBison"
```

After making this change, the model will be trained against the final opponent directly. Note that training against only the final opponent might make the model specialized for that particular opponent and may not generalize well to other opponents.
## User
if my agent game over, will it start from level 1? I don't want that, I just want it to train against Bison
## ChatGPT
To ensure that your agent continues training against Bison even after a game over, you can modify your custom environment to always reset to the Bison level. 

First, make sure you have the correct state string as mentioned before:

```python
state = "Champion.Level12.RyuVsMBison"
```

Then, in your `custom_sf2_env.py` file, you need to modify the `reset()` method to always set the emulator state to the Bison level. Here's an example of how you can do that:

```python
import retro

class CustomSF2Env(retro.RetroEnv):
    # ... other methods ...

    def reset(self):
        # Load the Bison level state
        self.em.set_state(self.initial_state)
        
        # Call the parent class's reset method to set up the environment properly
        return super().reset()
```

By modifying the `reset()` method, you ensure that every time the agent starts a new episode after a game over, it will still train against Bison. This way, your agent will continuously train against the final opponent.

## ChatGPT
It seems that there is an issue with loading the state file for the Bison level. The error message indicates that the state file could not be loaded because the filename is not in the expected format.

First, ensure that the state file for the Bison level is located in the correct directory. The state file should be inside the `StreetFighterIISpecialChampionEdition-Genesis` folder, which should be located in the `retro/data/stable/` directory.

Once you have confirmed the state file is in the correct location, double-check the value of the `state` variable in your `train.py` script. The variable should be set to the correct filename, including the file extension, like this:

```python
state = "Champion.Level12.RyuVsMBison.state"
```

If you're still encountering issues, please ensure that the state file is a valid gzip file and not corrupted. You can try to load the state file in a separate script to verify it's working correctly:

```python
import retro

env = retro.make("StreetFighterIISpecialChampionEdition-Genesis", "Champion.Level12.RyuVsMBison.state")
```

If the state file is still not working, you may need to create a new state file for the Bison level or find an alternative source for the state file.
## User
There is only 1 state file in that folder, how can I get the state files I need?
## ChatGPT
Creating a state file for a specific level in a game requires a few steps. In the case of Street Fighter II, you'll need to create a state file for the match against M. Bison.

Here's how you can create a new state file:

1. First, download and install RetroArch from the official website: https://www.retroarch.com/
2. Next, download the Genesis Plus GX core within RetroArch. To do this, open RetroArch, go to "Load Core" > "Download a Core", scroll down to find "Genesis Plus GX", and press Enter to download it.
3. Now, you need the game ROM. Ensure you have a legally obtained copy of "Street Fighter II': Special Champion Edition" for the Sega Genesis.
4. Load the game ROM in RetroArch. Go to "Load Content" > navigate to the folder containing your ROM > select the ROM file.
5. Play the game up to the point where Ryu is about to face M. Bison.
6. Once you have reached that point, save the state. In RetroArch, press the F2 key to save the state. By default, it will be saved in the first available slot (slot 0).
7. Locate the state file. State files are usually saved in the "states" folder within the RetroArch directory. The file should have a `.state` extension.
8. Rename the state file to something descriptive, like "Champion.Level12.RyuVsMBison.state".
9. Move the state file to the appropriate directory for Retro Gym. It should be placed inside the `StreetFighterIISpecialChampionEdition-Genesis` folder, which should be located in the `retro/data/stable/` directory.
10. Update your `train.py` script to use the new state file:

```python
state = "Champion.Level12.RyuVsMBison.state"
```

Now you should have a valid state file for the match against M. Bison. Your RL agent should start training from that specific level.
## User
do you mean I have to actually play the game to reach Bison? Is there any way I can avoid playing it? I simply cannot play that far
## ChatGPT
I understand that playing the game up to Bison might be challenging. An alternative approach is to use a cheat code to quickly access the match against M. Bison. For Street Fighter II': Special Champion Edition on Sega Genesis, you can use the level select cheat code. Here's how:

1. Start RetroArch with the Street Fighter II': Special Champion Edition ROM loaded.
2. At the main menu screen of the game, press the following buttons in sequence:
   A, B, A, C, A, B, B.
3. A new menu titled "Option Mode" will appear. Within this menu, you can adjust the game settings, including the starting level.
4. Change the starting level to "M. Bison" or the highest level possible.
5. Start the game with Ryu as your character and play through the match against M. Bison.
6. As soon as the match begins, create a save state in RetroArch by pressing the F2 key.
7. Locate the state file, rename it, and move it to the appropriate directory as mentioned in the previous response.
8. Update your `train.py` script to use the new state file.

Now, you should have a valid state file for the match against M. Bison without having to play through the entire game. Your RL agent will start training from that specific level.
## User
In this case, does 4 sub processes communicate with each other? Or they are independent training?
## ChatGPT
When using `SubprocVecEnv` with four subprocesses, each subprocess runs an independent environment, and they don't communicate with each other during the training. The main purpose of using multiple environments is to speed up the training process by generating more data samples per unit of time.

In this setup, the four environments are running in parallel, collecting experience independently. The main process collects these experiences from the subprocesses, updates the agent's model, and sends the updated model back to the subprocesses. The subprocesses then continue to generate more experience using the updated model.

The communication between the subprocesses and the main process is limited to sending and receiving the model updates, action choices, and observations. Each subprocess's environment operates independently, without any interaction or information exchange among the subprocesses during the training.
## User
do you mean for each iteration in each subprocess, the agent is updated in main process and will be used by other subprocesses?
## ChatGPT
Yes, that's correct. During training, the main process collects the experiences from each subprocess, and uses these experiences to update the agent's model. The updated model is then sent back to each subprocess so they can use it to generate more experience.

This approach effectively speeds up the training process by parallelizing the experience collection across multiple environments. The subprocesses do not directly communicate with each other; they only interact with the main process, which handles the model updates and synchronization.

In summary, the agent is updated in the main process, and these updates are used by the subprocesses running the independent environments to continue generating new experiences.
## User
one of my subprocess beat Bison and effectively finished the game, but it seems that it doesn't know game is over thus it is stuck there, no longer reset and retrain
## ChatGPT
This issue may be due to the environment not being set up to properly recognize when the game is over. You should modify your custom environment to detect when Bison has been defeated, and handle this event appropriately, such as resetting the environment or ending the episode.

You can implement this by monitoring the game state, rewards, or other game-specific indicators that Bison has been defeated. Once detected, you can set the `done` flag to `True` in your custom environment's `step()` function. This will inform the agent that the episode has ended, allowing it to reset and continue training.

Here's an example of how to do this in your `CustomSF2Env`:

```python
class CustomSF2Env(retro.RetroEnv):
    # ...
    def step(self, action):
        observation, reward, done, info = super().step(action)

        # Check if Bison has been defeated
        if self.is_bison_defeated(info):
            done = True

        return observation, reward, done, info

    def is_bison_defeated(self, info):
        # Implement your logic to detect if Bison has been defeated using the 'info' dictionary
        pass
```

Make sure to implement the `is_bison_defeated()` method according to the specific indicators that Bison has been defeated in the game. Once you have this in place, the environment should properly handle the end of the game, allowing the agent to reset and continue training.
## User
the A, B, A, C, A, B, B. cheat code doesn't seem to work, nothing happens, and I don't see Option Mode menu
## ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion earlier. The cheat code I provided might not be accurate for your specific version of the game. Cheat codes can vary depending on the game version and platform.

Since you're using the MAME-2003 Plus (MAME 0.78) version of Street Fighter II, you can try accessing the game's service menu to enable additional options. Here's how you can do that:

1. Launch the game.
2. Press the "Tab" key on your keyboard to access the MAME menu.
3. In the MAME menu, navigate to "Dip Switches."
4. Look for a setting called "Service Mode" or "Test Mode" and enable it.
5. Exit the MAME menu by pressing the "Tab" key again.
6. The game should now display the service menu, where you can change various settings.

Please note that the service menu options can vary depending on the specific game ROM you are using. If you don't see an "Option Mode" or any settings related to game difficulty, you might need to look for a different version of the game ROM that includes these settings. Additionally, the navigation keys and the key to access the MAME menu may differ based on your MAME configuration.
## User
no, I am using Genesis Plus GX
## ChatGPT
My apologies for the confusion. In that case, let's try another approach to access the options menu in Street Fighter II for the Sega Genesis using the Genesis Plus GX emulator:

1. Start the game and wait for the title screen to appear.
2. Press the "Start" button on your controller to access the main menu.
3. In the main menu, there should be an "Options" menu where you can adjust various settings, including the game's difficulty.

If the options menu does not appear, you may have a different version of the game. In that case, you can try finding another ROM version that includes the options menu.

Regarding the cheat code I mentioned earlier, it appears that it may not work for the Sega Genesis version of the game. The code was meant for the arcade version, and I apologize for any confusion caused.
## User
Why my training rendering pauses like 15 sec for every iteration
## ChatGPT
If the training rendering is pausing for 15 seconds at every iteration, there could be several reasons for this behavior:

1. **Resource limitations**: Your computer might not have enough resources (CPU, GPU, or memory) to handle the training and rendering simultaneously. This can cause pauses or slowdowns during the training process.

2. **Rendering frequency**: The rendering frequency might be set too high, causing the training to pause frequently for rendering. You can try reducing the rendering frequency or disabling it entirely during training to see if it improves performance.

3. **Synchronization issues**: If you are using parallel environments (e.g., with SubprocVecEnv), there might be synchronization issues between the subprocesses, causing some of them to wait for others, resulting in pauses during rendering.

To investigate further, you can try the following steps:

1. Check your computer's resource usage (CPU, GPU, memory) during training. If you observe high usage, consider closing other applications or upgrading your hardware.

2. Adjust the rendering settings in your training script, such as reducing the frequency of rendering or disabling it entirely. You can always enable rendering after training for evaluation purposes.

3. Ensure that your environments are correctly set up and synchronized if you're using parallel environments. You can also try using a single environment to see if the issue persists.

4. Monitor the training logs for any error messages or warnings that might indicate an issue during training. This could provide more information on the cause of the pauses.

If the issue persists, please provide more information about your training setup, such as the hardware you're using, the training script, and any modifications you've made to the environment or algorithm, to help diagnose the problem further.

## User
how can I save the model every 20 iterations?
## ChatGPT
To save your model every 20 iterations, you can modify the training loop to include a condition that checks if the current iteration is a multiple of 20, and if it is, save the model. Here's an example of how to do this using Stable Baselines:

```python
import os

model_save_dir = "saved_models"
os.makedirs(model_save_dir, exist_ok=True)

total_iterations = 1000
save_interval = 20

for i in range(total_iterations):
    model.learn(total_timesteps=1) # Train the model for one step
    
    if (i + 1) % save_interval == 0:
        model_save_path = os.path.join(model_save_dir, f"model_iter_{i + 1}.zip")
        model.save(model_save_path)
        print(f"Model saved at iteration {i + 1} to {model_save_path}")
```

This code will train the model for 1000 iterations, saving it every 20 iterations to the "saved_models" directory. Adjust the `total_iterations` and `save_interval` variables as needed.

## ChatGPT
To save your model every 20 iterations in your `train.py` file, you can add a callback that checks the current iteration and saves the model if the iteration is a multiple of 20. First, create a new callback class that inherits from `BaseCallback`:

```python
class SaveEveryNIterationsCallback(BaseCallback):
    def __init__(self, save_interval: int, model_save_dir: str):
        super(SaveEveryNIterationsCallback, self).__init__()
        self.save_interval = save_interval
        self.model_save_dir = model_save_dir
        os.makedirs(model_save_dir, exist_ok=True)

    def _on_step(self) -> bool:
        iteration = self.num_timesteps
        if iteration % self.save_interval == 0:
            model_save_path = os.path.join(self.model_save_dir, f"model_iter_{iteration}.zip")
            self.model.save(model_save_path)
            print(f"Model saved at iteration {iteration} to {model_save_path}")
        return True
```

Then, modify the `main()` function in `train.py` to use the `SaveEveryNIterationsCallback`:

```python
def main():
    ...
    save_interval = 20
    model_save_dir = "saved_models"

    callback = SaveEveryNIterationsCallback(save_interval, model_save_dir)

    model = PPO("CnnPolicy", env, policy_kwargs=policy_kwargs, verbose=1, device='cuda')
    model.learn(total_timesteps=int(1e6), callback=callback)
    ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code will save your model every 20 iterations to the "saved_models" directory. Adjust the `save_interval` variable as needed.
## User
how do I access iteration in my custom env class?
## ChatGPT
To access the current iteration in your custom environment class, you can use a simple counter. You'll need to create a new attribute in your `CustomSF2Env` class and increment it on each step. 

Here's how you can modify your `CustomSF2Env` class to include an iteration counter:

```python
class CustomSF2Env(retro.RetroEnv):
    def __init__(self, game, state, scenario=None, info=None, use_restricted_actions=retro.Actions.FILTERED, *args, **kwargs):
        super(CustomSF2Env, self).__init__(game, state, scenario, info, use_restricted_actions, *args, **kwargs)
        self.printed = False
        self.info = None
        self.info_prev = None
        self.done = False
        self.iteration_counter = 0  # Add the iteration counter attribute

    def step(self, action):
        self.iteration_counter += 1  # Increment the iteration counter on each step
        obs, reward, done, info = super(CustomSF2Env, self).step(action)
        ...
```

Now, you can access the current iteration using the `iteration_counter` attribute of your custom environment class:

```python
current_iteration = custom_env_instance.iteration_counter
```

Please note that this counter will be specific to each environment instance. If you are using multiple environments in parallel, each environment will have its own iteration counter.
## User
is this counter counting iteration or timestep?
## ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. The counter I provided in the previous response is actually counting timesteps, not iterations. In a reinforcement learning context, an iteration typically refers to a single update of the model's parameters, while a timestep refers to a single step within an episode.

The counter I provided is incremented every time the `step()` method is called, which corresponds to a single timestep in the environment. However, accessing the iteration count in the custom environment class is not straightforward, as it depends on the specific algorithm being used and its internal workings.

If you want to save the model every 20 iterations, you should create a custom callback for your training loop. Here's a simple example of how you can create a callback to save the model every 20 iterations:

```python
from stable_baselines3.common.callbacks import BaseCallback

class SaveEveryNIterationsCallback(BaseCallback):
    def __init__(self, save_freq: int, model_path: str):
        super(SaveEveryNIterationsCallback, self).__init__()
        self.save_freq = save_freq
        self.model_path = model_path

    def _on_step(self) -> bool:
        if (self.num_timesteps // self.n_calls) % self.save_freq == 0:
            self.model.save(f"{self.model_path}_iter{self.num_timesteps // self.n_calls}")
        return True
```

And then, use this callback in your `train.py` script:

```python
save_every_n_iterations_callback = SaveEveryNIterationsCallback(save_freq=20, model_path=model_path)
model.learn(total_timesteps=int(1e6), callback=save_every_n_iterations_callback)
```

This will save the model every 20 iterations.
## User
now each iteration consists 8192 timesteps, so it seems I can use timestep count to get iteration count in my env. How do I access timestep count in my env? more specifically,  how to access total_timesteps?
## ChatGPT
You can access the current timestep count within the environment by passing it through the custom callback. Here's an example of how you can modify your callback and environment class to achieve this:

1. Modify your `CustomSF2Env` class to include a `timestep_count` attribute and a method to update it:

```python
class CustomSF2Env(retro.RetroEnv):
    def __init__(self, ...):
        ...
        self.timestep_count = 0

    def update_timestep_count(self, count):
        self.timestep_count = count
```

2. Modify your custom callback `RenderEveryTenEpisodesCallback` to update the timestep count of each environment:

```python
class RenderEveryTenEpisodesCallback(BaseCallback):
    ...
    def _on_step(self) -> bool:
        ...
        for env in self.training_env.envs:
            env.update_timestep_count(self.num_timesteps)
        return True
```

Now, you should have access to the `timestep_count` attribute in your environment, which you can use to determine the current iteration count if you know the number of timesteps per iteration.

Keep in mind that this approach relies on the specific algorithm being used and the configuration of the training loop. The relationship between timesteps and iterations might change if you change the learning algorithm or its parameters.

## ChatGPT
The error you are encountering is because the saved model was trained with a different number of parallel environments than you are trying to use now. When you load the model and continue training, the model expects the same number of parallel environments as before.

To fix this issue, you can use the same number of parallel environments that were used during the initial training. Alternatively, if you want to change the number of parallel environments, you will need to load the saved model and create a new model with the desired number of parallel environments while copying the learned parameters.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

```python
import torch

def copy_model_parameters(source_model, target_model):
    target_model.policy.load_state_dict(source_model.policy.state_dict())

def main():
    ...
    num_envs = 6  # Change this to the desired number of parallel environments

    # Create a vectorized environment with multiple parallel environments
    env = SubprocVecEnv([make_env(env_id, state) for _ in range(num_envs)])

    policy_kwargs = {
        "features_extractor_class": CustomCNN,
        "features_extractor_kwargs": {"feature_dim": 128},
    }

    # Load the saved model
    saved_model = PPO.load(model_path)

    # Create a new model with the desired number of parallel environments
    new_model = PPO("CnnPolicy", env, policy_kwargs=policy_kwargs, verbose=1, device='cuda')

    # Copy the learned parameters from the saved model to the new model
    copy_model_parameters(saved_model, new_model)

    # Continue training the new model
    new_model.learn(total_timesteps=int(1e6), callback=save_every_n_iterations_callback)

    # Save the new model
    new_model.save(model_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This way, you can change the number of parallel environments and continue training the model without encountering errors.
## User
I tried to save every 5 iterations, but it doesn't seems to work, nothing saved and now I am at iteration 8
## ChatGPT
It seems that you have not provided the code for the `save_every_n_iterations_callback` in your question. I'll provide you with a callback example that saves the model every 5 iterations.

First, you need to create a custom callback that saves the model every 5 iterations. Here's an example:

```python
class SaveEveryNIterationsCallback(BaseCallback):
    def __init__(self, save_freq: int, save_path: str):
        super(SaveEveryNIterationsCallback, self).__init__()
        self.save_freq = save_freq
        self.save_path = save_path
        self.current_iteration = 0

    def _on_step(self) -> bool:
        game_over = self.training_env.get_attr('game_over')[0]
        if game_over:
            self.current_iteration += 1
            if self.current_iteration % self.save_freq == 0:
                print(f'Saving model at iteration {self.current_iteration}')
                self.model.save(f"{self.save_path}_iteration_{self.current_iteration}")

        return True
```

Then, you can use this callback in your `main()` function:

```python
def main():
    ...
    model_path = 'models/sf2_model'

    ...
    save_every_n_iterations_callback = SaveEveryNIterationsCallback(save_freq=5, save_path=model_path)

    model.learn(total_timesteps=int(1e6), callback=save_every_n_iterations_callback)

    model.save(model_path)
```

This will save the model every 5 iterations. Please note that depending on the speed of the training, it might take some time before the first save occurs.
## User
my current callback is 

class SaveEveryNIterationsCallback(BaseCallback):
    def __init__(self, save_freq: int, model_path: str):
        super(SaveEveryNIterationsCallback, self).__init__()
        self.save_freq = save_freq
        self.model_path = model_path

    def _on_step(self) -> bool:
        if (self.num_timesteps // self.n_calls) % self.save_freq == 0:
            self.model.save(f"{self.model_path}_iter{self.num_timesteps // self.n_calls}")
        return True


And this is exactly you provide last time, could you figure out the issue?
## ChatGPT
Apologies for the confusion. It seems I misunderstood the previous implementation. Let's update the callback to properly count the iterations and save the model every 5 iterations:

```python
class SaveEveryNIterationsCallback(BaseCallback):
    def __init__(self, save_freq: int, model_path: str):
        super(SaveEveryNIterationsCallback, self).__init__()
        self.save_freq = save_freq
        self.model_path = model_path
        self.iterations = 0

    def _on_step(self) -> bool:
        game_over = self.training_env.get_attr('game_over')[0]
        if game_over:
            self.iterations += 1
            if self.iterations % self.save_freq == 0:
                print(f'Saving model at iteration {self.iterations}')
                self.model.save(f"{self.model_path}_iter{self.iterations}")
        return True
```

This callback will now properly count the iterations by checking if the game is over, and save the model every 5 iterations. Make sure to use this updated callback in your `main()` function:

```python
def main():
    ...
    model_path = 'models/sf2_model'

    ...
    save_every_n_iterations_callback = SaveEveryNIterationsCallback(save_freq=5, model_path=model_path)

    model.learn(total_timesteps=int(1e6), callback=save_every_n_iterations_callback)

    model.save(model_path)
```

This should now work as intended and save the model every 5 iterations.
## User
This is saving every 5 episodes instead of 5 iterations, right?
## ChatGPT
Yes, you are correct. My apologies for the confusion. The callback I provided saves the model every 5 episodes, not iterations.

To save the model every 5 iterations, we need to use the `n_updates` attribute of the PPO model. Here's the updated callback:

```python
class SaveEveryNIterationsCallback(BaseCallback):
    def __init__(self, save_freq: int, model_path: str):
        super(SaveEveryNIterationsCallback, self).__init__()
        self.save_freq = save_freq
        self.model_path = model_path

    def _on_step(self) -> bool:
        if self.n_calls % self.save_freq == 0:
            print(f'Saving model at iteration {self.n_calls // self.save_freq}')
            self.model.save(f"{self.model_path}_iter{self.n_calls // self.save_freq}")
        return True
```

And in your `main()` function, make sure to pass the `n_steps` parameter to your model:

```python
def main():
    ...
    model = PPO("CnnPolicy", env, policy_kwargs=policy_kwargs, verbose=1, device='cuda', n_steps=2048)
    ...
    save_every_n_iterations_callback = SaveEveryNIterationsCallback(save_freq=5, model_path=model_path)
    model.learn(total_timesteps=int(1e6), callback=save_every_n_iterations_callback)
    ...
```

Now the model should save every 5 iterations. Note that the number of timesteps in an iteration is determined by the `n_steps` parameter of the PPO model. In this case, I've set it to 2048, which means an iteration consists of 2048 timesteps. If you want to change the number of timesteps per iteration, modify the `n_steps` parameter accordingly.
## User
you said we need to use n_updates, but in code you use n_calls, which one is correct? and what does n_updates or n_calls mean?
## ChatGPT
Apologies for the confusion. I mentioned `n_updates` earlier, but in the code, I used `n_calls`. In this case, we should use `n_calls`. The `n_calls` attribute counts the total number of calls to the `_on_step` method, which corresponds to the number of times the callback is called. In the context of PPO, the callback is called after each iteration.

So, the correct implementation is:

```python
class SaveEveryNIterationsCallback(BaseCallback):
    def __init__(self, save_freq: int, model_path: str):
        super(SaveEveryNIterationsCallback, self).__init__()
        self.save_freq = save_freq
        self.model_path = model_path

    def _on_step(self) -> bool:
        if self.n_calls % self.save_freq == 0:
            print(f'Saving model at iteration {self.n_calls // self.save_freq}')
            self.model.save(f"{self.model_path}_iter{self.n_calls // self.save_freq}")
        return True
```

`n_calls` represents the total number of times the `_on_step` method has been called, which corresponds to the number of iterations for PPO. Thus, using `n_calls` in the callback helps us save the model every `save_freq` iterations.
## User
it is saving every timestep
## ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion earlier. It seems that the callback is being called every timestep, not just after every iteration. In that case, let's modify the callback to track the number of completed episodes across all environments and save the model based on that.

```python
class SaveEveryNIterationsCallback(BaseCallback):
    def __init__(self, save_freq: int, model_path: str):
        super(SaveEveryNIterationsCallback, self).__init__()
        self.save_freq = save_freq
        self.model_path = model_path
        self.episode_counter = 0

    def _on_step(self) -> bool:
        if self.training_env.get_attr('game_over')[0]:
            self.episode_counter += 1

        if self.episode_counter % (self.save_freq * self.training_env.num_envs) == 0:
            print(f'Saving model at {self.episode_counter // self.training_env.num_envs} iterations')
            self.model.save(f"{self.model_path}_iter{self.episode_counter // self.training_env.num_envs}")
        
        return True
```

This modified callback checks if any of the environments have completed an episode (i.e., the game is over). It keeps a count of the total completed episodes across all environments, and when that count is a multiple of `save_freq * num_envs`, it saves the model. This will ensure that the model is saved after every `save_freq` iterations.

Please note that this method assumes that all environments will complete an episode at roughly the same time, which is generally the case when training with PPO.

## ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. It looks like the condition for saving the model is being met multiple times in a row, which is causing multiple save attempts for the same iteration count. To fix this issue, we can add a flag to prevent multiple save attempts for the same iteration count.

Here's an updated version of the callback:

```python
class SaveEveryNIterationsCallback(BaseCallback):
    def __init__(self, save_freq: int, model_path: str):
        super(SaveEveryNIterationsCallback, self).__init__()
        self.save_freq = save_freq
        self.model_path = model_path
        self.episode_counter = 0
        self.saved_last_iteration = False

    def _on_step(self) -> bool:
        if self.training_env.get_attr('game_over')[0]:
            self.episode_counter += 1
            self.saved_last_iteration = False

        if self.episode_counter % (self.save_freq * self.training_env.num_envs) == 0 and not self.saved_last_iteration:
            print(f'Saving model at {self.episode_counter // self.training_env.num_envs} iterations')
            self.model.save(f"{self.model_path}_iter{self.episode_counter // self.training_env.num_envs}")
            self.saved_last_iteration = True

        return True
```

This version of the callback introduces a new flag `saved_last_iteration`. When the model is saved, this flag is set to `True`, preventing the model from being saved again for the same iteration count. When a new episode starts, the flag is reset to `False`, allowing the model to be saved at the next multiple of `save_freq * num_envs`.

do all subprocesses share the same callback instance?
## ChatGPT
Yes, all subprocesses share the same callback instance. When you create a callback and pass it to the `learn` method of the model, it's the same callback instance that is being used across all subprocesses during the training. However, each subprocess operates independently, and any state changes made within the callback will be shared across all subprocesses.

I got this error after my play.py completes, the test runs fine though, below is my play.py


from model import CustomCNN, PPO
from stable_baselines3.common.vec_env import DummyVecEnv
import retro


def main():
    env_id = "StreetFighterIISpecialChampionEdition-Genesis"
    state = "Champion.Level12.RyuVsBison"
    model_path = '../models/sf2_model_iter70'
    test_rounds = 10

    env = retro.make(game=env_id, state=state)
    env = DummyVecEnv([lambda: env])

    policy_kwargs = {
        "features_extractor_class": CustomCNN,
        "features_extractor_kwargs": {"feature_dim": 128},
    }

    model = PPO.load(model_path, env)

    for i in range(1, test_rounds + 1):
        obs = env.reset()
        while True:
            action, _states = model.predict(obs)
            obs, rewards, done, info = env.step(action)
            if info[0]['matches_won'] == 2:
                print(f'{i}: Won')
                break
            if info[0]['enemy_matches_won'] == 2:
                print(f'{i}: Lost')
                break
            env.render()

    env.close()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


this is the error

## ChatGPT
This error occurs when the rendering window is closed, and it's likely due to some underlying issue with Pyglet (the library used for rendering in Gym) in handling the window closing procedure on your system. However, since your script appears to be running fine and completes the test rounds, you can consider this error to be non-critical.

If you want to suppress the error, you can add the following code at the beginning of your script:

```python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=ResourceWarning)
```

This will suppress the `ResourceWarning` that is being raised in this case. However, please note that this will also suppress other `ResourceWarning` messages, so use it with caution.
